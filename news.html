        		<h6>09 | 08 | 17</h6>
        

         		<p>Gaelic sports fans and concert goers at a newly redeveloped stadium can
            now enjoy a cool beer or cider served in seconds from Qualflow’s Velx swift taps.
            The new stadium situated by the Lee river, County Cork, Ireland has a capacity of 45,000. With an
            average dispense time of 6 seconds per twin spout, the patent pending Velx
            dispense system can pour 10,500 pints during gameplay intermission to ensure
            that thirsty fans get a pint when beer demand is at its peak.</p>

			<p>Qualflow was selected to develop and supply the new Velx Twin Tap
      for the stadium. While the stadium was being redeveloped, Qualflow engineers worked
      with the brewer and the stadium caterer, Compass, on all aspects of the
      dispense system including, python selection, cooling requirements and bar layout.
      The dispense solution developed by the joint team uses beer pumps to ensures high
      speed of pour in bars located at the south stand. Bars on the south stand are
      located 15m above and 120m away from the keg store.</p>

        <p>This summer sees the official launch of our Swift Tap, Velx. Launched this summer on Kit
        and Caboodle's mobile bars, Velx has dispensed 1000s of beers at many of the

        keg yield. This results in increased beer sales with less staff.</p>

        <p>Operation is simple with button press for half pint, full pint and jug metered pour;
        button hold for top off and button combination press for calibration and clean modes.</p>

     				<h6>03 | 11 | 15</h6>

       				<p>Innserve, the leading UK dispense service company, celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. Qualflow's history as a supplier to Innserve spans almost all of these 				years. In fact, Innserve was Qualflow's first UK customer and we are delighted that the fixed beer-line cleaner we supplied is still in operation at the MEN Arena in 					Manchester.
				</p>

				<p>Over the years, we have continued to provide innovative beer-line cleaning solutions to Innserve, including the PLCS portable beer-line cleaner. The PLCS is used by 				Innserve's service technicians to clean beer-lines at stadiums and venues with large tap numbers. For its restaurants and smaller pub operators, Innserve needed a compact 					hand-carry line cleaning pump, suitable for cleaning small tap numbers. To meet this requirement, Qualflow in partnership with Innserve, developed the Mini-PLCS.
				The Mini-PLCS is truly compact with case dimensions of 36x29x16cm. It is housed in a military specification hand-carry case and shares many of the features of the highly 					reliable PLCS. A compact 24V pump delivers turbulent-flowing detergent, providing additional mechanical action to ensure lines are cleaned to the highest standard. 					Following evaluation of a number of prototypes, Qualflow shipped the first lot of Mini-PLCS line cleaners to Innserve this summer.</p>

				<p>We are proud to be a supplier to Innserve and we wish them continued success.</p>

     				<h6>7 | 09 | 15</h6>

       				<p>It is that time of the year again when Qualflow head off to Nuremberg to attend Europe’s
            			premier beverage and brewing exhibition, Brau. Company founders Ciaran O'Morain and Dr.
            			Justin Lawler will meet with a number of customers including key equipment suppliers
            			and brewers. This year we will be introducing our latest beer-line cleaning innovation
            			Vortex. Developed with Diageo Ireland, Vortex has two modes of operation, traditional
            			soak or recirculation (Recirc).</p>

    				<p>In Recirc mode, detergent is recirculated to enhance the turbulent action of the detergent.
              			The mechanical action due to turbulence gives a clean that is up to 50% more effective
              			than the traditional soak. Vortex has a number of unique technologies to ensure
              			operation during the turbulent regime. In addition a Bluetooth module allows
              			communication with the Vortex App on the dispense engineer's iPad. The data can
              			be uploaded to the cloud, allowing remote monitoring and reporting of line cleaning
              			activity. When the roll-out phase is complete with Diageo Ireland, the Vortex App will
              			provide updates on beer-line cleaning activity from ~10,000 monthly pub visits. </p>

   				in the UK but we are especially pleased to announce that VerxClean was installed in The Three
   				Tun Tavern, Wetherspoon's first pub in southern Ireland. The pub opened last July in Dublin's
   				leafy suburb of Blackrock. The beautifully refurbished interior reflects the local history and
   				adds considerably to the enjoyment of a pint.</p>

				<p>The enjoyment and quality of the beer is also helped by VerxClean. Unlike other beer-line
				cleaners, VerxClean keeps lines full of detergent during all stages of the clean cycle, to
				give best-in-class line hygiene. This in turn allows our customers to serve brewery fresh beer.

 				<h6>20 | 05 | 14</h6>

   				<p>Qualflow are delighted to announce the introduction of VerxClean™. Derived from the Latin word “Verax”
   				meaning true or truthful, VerxClean offers the pub and hospitality industry full automation of the beer-line
   				cleaning process. With VerxClean, it is now possible to clean lines to the highest standard across multiple
   				outlets. This in turn increases beer sales, keg yields and group profitability.</p>

				<p>VerxClean combines Qualflow’s established detergent delivery technology with new patent pending Smart
				Hoses to automate all steps of the cleaning process. The Smart Hoses automate the closing of beer taps to
				ensure lines remain full of detergent during the traditional soak stage of the clean. </p>

				<p>Automating this critical step allows true “one button” operation and best in class beer-line hygiene.
				This in turn allows our customers to deliver brewery fresh beer with every serve.<p/>

				<p>The technology is field proven and has been in operation with a major UK pub group for the past year.
				 Thanks to our friends at Xylem Water Solutions Inc, VerxClean will get its first public viewing at this
				 year's National Restaurant Association show in Chicago.</p>

 				<h6>18 | 01 | 14</h6>

  				<p>The O2 London, Brewers Spendrups (Stockholm), and Revels and House Dublin are among some of
  				the first customers to install Qualflow’s new compact Auto-Keg Changer.</p>

  				<p>Based on Qualflow’s established keg changer technology the new compact system works with
  				free flow and automated dispense systems. For high speed dispense applications the keg changer
  				is fitted with an extra large FOB.</p>

  				<p>Auto-Keg Changer allows you maximize sales by allowing uninterrupted service in high volume outlets
  				 such as clubs, stadiums and busy pubs.</p>

  				<p>Unlike other keg changers Qualflow’s changer works with one, two or three kegs so you only tap what
  				you need. Keg status lights allow staff identify full, empty and serving kegs during service. This
  				unique feature combined with automatic FOB venting means that staff only have to swap out empty kegs
  				during service to allow true uninterrupted flow.</p>

 				<h6>15 | 08 | 13</h6>

    				<p>Gibney's, the famous north county Dublin pub, has joined the growing number of tier one venues to install SellOff.</p>

				<p>Installed on sixteen beer-lines, SellOff will reduce beer wastage due to line cleaning by approximately 1,232 pints per annum.
				The staff at Gibney's have traditionally managed beer wastage due to line cleaning using manual methods. However, in busy pubs like
				Gibney's, manual methods are not always effective and wastage can remain high. With SellOff, bar managers can shut down and sell
				off beer in the line from the bar with the simple press of a button. The simplicity of operation is the key to the success of
				Qualflow's automated beer sell off system.</p>

				<p>Located in Belfast’s university district the iconic Botanic Inn, or Bot as it is known locally, installed Qualflow’s Beer
				SellOff system to help reduce the high cost of cleaning its beer-lines.</p>

				<p>Since installation on forty beer-lines, SellOff has helped staff reduce beer-line cleaning wastage by up to 90%.
				With over forty lines requiring regular cleaning, managing the sale of beer in the lines before cleaning has not
				been practical using manual methods. SellOff has solved this problem by eliminating all manual intervention. Staff
				can now turn line cleaning wastage into beer sales at the touch of a button.<p/>

				<p>English cricket had a great season at Lord's this year. The grounds, catering and bar staff also had a win with
				Beer SellOff. Installed on 64 beer-lines, SellOff is reducing beer wastage by up to 320 pints before the lines are
				cleaned using our portable line cleaner, PLCS.</p>

 				<h6>10 | 09 | 12</h6>

    				<p>Qualflow’s Beer SellOff™ is the first fully automated beer sell off system that can turn losses from beer-line cleaning
    				into sales. Available this summer, Beer SellOff helps pubs drive down the cost of maintaining good beer-line hygiene.</p>

				<p>Unlike other systems that claim to save money by reducing the need to clean beer-lines regularly, Beer SellOff reduces
				line cleaning costs without compromising on the quality delivered by regular line cleaning.  Moreover, because clean beer-lines
				deliver quality beer, customer satisfaction, loyalty and therefore sales, increase.</p>

				<p>Beer SellOff is simple to operate using a one touch selector located in the bar. This means that staff can simply and
				conveniently select the lines they want to use for sell off. Beer SellOff’s automation allows bar staff manage the shutdown
				and sell off of products in a controlled and practical way.</p>

				<p>This is unlike other beer-saver systems, that require manual intervention and frequent trips to the cellar.</p>

 				<h6>10 | 03 | 12</h6>

				<p>A major Irish brewer has just completed equipping its entire field services team with 200 of Qualflow’s portable
				beer-line cleaning systems (PLCS). The PLCS replaces the traditional wash bottle to deliver improved productivity and better beer-line hygiene.</p>

				<p>On a monthly basis the PLCS systems  are used to clean over 104,000 beer-lines. This represents over one million
				line cleaning procedures in a year. The sheer scale of the line cleaning operation is a testament to the robustness and quality of the company’s equipment.</p>

				<p>The project was one of Qualflow's major success stories last year and is the culmination of a major scope of work that included:</p>

				<ul class="square">
					<li>Co-design of a new beer-line cleaning process with the brewer.</li>
					<li>Development and evaluation of the new process at multiple venues, pubs, hotel bars and restaurants.</li>
					<li>Roll-out of the PLCS technology including new process and equipment training to the brewers quality team.</li>
					<li>Ongoing validation of the new line cleaning process and PLCS equipment performance.</li>
				</ul>


				<p>Project results to date demonstrate that the PLCS delivers improved productivity, better line hygiene and serve quality compared to the traditional wash bottle.</p>
