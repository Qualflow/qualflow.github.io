Roundhouse, the famous music and performing arts venue, has hosted some of the world's greatest musicians including The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan and David Bowie. We are delighted to announce that the Velx Swift Tap will be installed in the historical, circular building in Camden.

With only four components, Velx simplifies metered-dispense. The simple design reduces the cost of ownership compared to other fast pour systems.

The fonts slick, tubular design and brushed stainless steel finish will fit right in at the Roundhouse bars.
