Gaelic sports fans and concert goers at the newly redeveloped Páirc Uí Chaoimh can
now enjoy a cool beer or cider served in seconds from Qualflow’s Velx swift taps.
The new stadium situated by the Lee river has a capacity of 45,000. With an
average dispense time of 6 seconds per twin spout, the patent pending Velx
dispense system can pour 10,500 pints during gameplay intermission to ensure
that thirsty fans get a pint when beer demand is at its peak.

Qualflow was selected by Heineken Ireland to develop and supply the new Velx Twin Tap
for the stadium. While the stadium was being redeveloped, Qualflow engineers work
with Heineken Ireland and the stadium caterer, Compass, on all aspect of the
dispense system including, python selection cooling requirements and bar layout.
The dispense solution developed by the joint team uses beer pumps to ensures high
speed of pour in bars located at the south stand. Bars on the south stand are
located 15m above and 120m away from the keg store.
